     
Variable: Are containers for storing value.

Datatypes: Storing data of diff types which perform diff actions.
   Ex: str,int,float,comples,list,tuple,range.
   
Function : Is a block of code whch only runs when it is called.   
        Advantages: * we can avoid rewriting the same code in one prgm.
                    * we can track a large prgm easily whn it is divided into multiple functions.
                    * we can call function anywhere & call multiple times.

Parameter: Is a variable listed inside parenthesis in function definition.

Argument: Is the value that is sent to function when it is called.


Built-in Function: Is a function that is already available in a program language.
    ->print
      print("Hello world")
      
    ->input
      input("enter your name")
      
    ->type
      a = 3
      type(a)
      
    ->abs(absolute function / modulous function)
      abs(-4) => 4
      
User defined function: Function that is defined by the user to do certain task.

Recursive function: Function that calls itself

Keyword: Reserved words that have specific meaning & purpose.
          Ex: and,as,def,del,class,True,False....
          
PEP(Python Enhancement Proposal)
    Is a design that describes new features for python community.
    
    - PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code
    – PEP 257 – Docstring Conventions
    
    -> Surround binary operators by a single space
         e.g. (“x + y” not “x+y”).
    -> Comments should be complete sentences.
    -> Class names should begin with a capital, and each distinct word in a class name should be capitalized. (e.g. class FileMonitor)
    -> Module names, function names, and variable names should be lower case with words separated by underscores (e.g. def do_something())
    
Escape Characters
  -> To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.
  -> An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
  -> An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:
       Ex: txt = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."  -------->ERROR
        
           txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."
           
   \'	  Single Quote	
  \\	  Backslash	
  \n	  New Line	
  \r	  Carriage Return	
  \t	  Tab	
  \b	  Backspace	
  \f	  Form Feed	
  \ooo	Octal value	
  \xhh	Hex value
